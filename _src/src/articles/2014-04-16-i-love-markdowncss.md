As developer I started with Markdown few years ago, when GitHub started trending.
I'd like to remember the true Markdown father John Gruber and the his [Markdown post](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

I started using the Markdown syntax almost for everything and if you aren't doing so, please you have to.

It's a great too, it makes possible to write HTML knowing nothing about that.

You can use a simple text editor, and most important, it can be "embedded" in whatever website, desktop app or mobile.
Seriously, they should teach it in school.

### so?
More than once I had to create css styles for the html result of markdowns, and you probably know I'm talking about the most important html tags: `<h[1-6]>`, `<p>`, `<ul|ol>`, `<blockquote>`, `<code>`, `<pre>`, `<em>`, `<a>` and few others.

Then I thought I would be cool to create a css that would dress up everything like the plain markdown source.

### check it out
That's why I created [i-love-markdown.css](https://stealthefish.com/i-love-markdown.css/index.html).

I started with a simple css then ended up with a less file and a container so it'll be easy to integrate it with existent websites.

After I finished I googled a bit for something similar and I discovered many others had my same idea...

One of my favorites is: [markdown-css (http://mrcoles.com/demo/markdown-css/)](http://mrcoles.com/demo/markdown-css/)
